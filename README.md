User-Friendly Interfaces: We've designed intuitive interfaces for both administrators and users, making the system accessible and user-centric.

Customizable Rates: Administrators have the flexibility to adapt rates and charges, keeping up with changing pricing policies.

Electronic Billing: No more paper receipts. Billing notifications are electronically generated and sent to users for convenience.

Secure Data Management: Your data is safe with us. We prioritize data security and protect sensitive user information.

Scalability: The system can efficiently handle a growing number of users and data as the university expands.

We've utilized the Flutter framework to create the user-friendly frontend of our system, ensuring a responsive and engaging user interface.

### Backend: 
Our system's backend is powered by PHP, enabling robust data processing and seamless communication between the frontend and the database. We've also implemented custom REST APIs to facilitate data exchange between components.
